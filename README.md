# Retail Sales Analysis with Superstore Dataset

Comprehensive SQL-driven business analysis of retail sales data using SQLite embedded in Python.

### Overview
Performed end-to-end analysis on the Sample Superstore retail dataset (~10,000 rows) to uncover profitability trends and performance insights.  
- Loaded CSV data into an in-memory SQLite database and cleaned column names for query compatibility  
- Executed advanced SQL queries: aggregations (SUM, COUNT), grouping (GROUP BY), window functions (RANK), CTEs (WITH), and date parsing (strftime)  
- Generated key business metrics: total sales/profit/quantity by region, top products/categories by profit, profit margins by customer segment, and monthly sales/profit trends  
- Visualized time-series trends with line plots and interpreted findings (e.g., regional profitability drivers, segment performance ranking)  

Demonstrates strong SQL proficiency (joins, subqueries/CTEs, window functions, date manipulation) combined with Python for full data workflow and actionable business storytelling — ideal for entry-level data analyst or junior data scientist roles.

### Tech Stack
- SQL (SQLite)  
- Python (pandas, sqlite3)  
- Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
