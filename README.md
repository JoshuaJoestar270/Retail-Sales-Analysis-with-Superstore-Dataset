# Retail-Sales-Analysis-with-Superstore-Dataset
Performed comprehensive SQL-based analysis on the Sample Superstore retail dataset (~10,000 rows) using SQLite embedded in Python.
Loaded and prepared data in an in-memory SQLite database, cleaned column names, and executed complex queries including aggregations (SUM, COUNT), grouping (GROUP BY), window functions (RANK), CTEs (WITH), and date parsing (strftime).
Generated key business insights: total sales/profit/quantity by region, top-performing products/categories, profit margins by customer segment, and monthly sales/profit trends over time.
Visualized results with matplotlib/seaborn (line plots for trends) and interpreted findings (e.g., regional profitability drivers, segment performance ranking).
Demonstrates strong SQL proficiency (joins, subqueries/CTEs, window functions, date manipulation) combined with Python for end-to-end data exploration and business storytelling—ideal for data analyst/scientist roles.

Tech Stack: SQL (SQLite), Python (pandas, sqlite3, matplotlib, seaborn)
